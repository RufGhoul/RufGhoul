Hi, I'm Rufida 👋  

Computer Engineering graduate who enjoys doing what I am advised not to do. (until I try it myself)
🧪 Interested in penetration Testing.   
🔐 Background in penetration testing fundamentals, microprocessing, robotics, AI/ machine learning, and algorithms/database. 
💻 Experience with C, C++, C#, Python, SQL, and arduino. 
🛠 Tools: Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Kali Linux  

I care about creativity, quality, and security rather than internet addictivity.  
Currently learning manual testing, test case design, and bug reporting.
